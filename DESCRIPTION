Title: Fast Bayesian GP sampling using H and H^2 matrices
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Matt Wheeler, Kelly Moran, Steffen Boern
Maintainer: Matt Wheelerr <matt.wheeler@nih.gov>
Description: This package provides various functionality
    to utilize H/H^2 matrices for near exact GP sampling in O(n log^2 n) time
    versus the traditional O(n^3) time. An effort is made to both provide a 
    vanilla GP sampler as well as individual 1-at-a-time conditional Gibbs samples.
